Test Data for the Weather Prediction
========================

This software used to provide non existing sequences of weather data in buildings applications with a method adopted to all kind of climates. There are four modules of description, modelling, generations, and evaluation of weather data. Except fact data in item.txt, a user also can modified the dataset via alerts.json file.  The value of "temperaturechange" can be change to any value in alerts.json. For example, setting { "temperaturechange":1} which means all dataset will be increased 1% if a user want a warm sequence.

It develop with java 1.7 on Eclipse with MacOs 10.10.x. A nested HashMap is used to store items in this model because the  time complexity for look up and insert a HashMap is O(1) if there is not a hash collision. The Arrays<> is good solution to replace this hashMap if the number of items is defined.

The algorithms in this application are reference some research papers in following
